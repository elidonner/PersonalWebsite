        At DEKA, I gained real-world experience as part of a team of approximately 80 engineers over two summer internships working on the same medical-device. In my first summer as a manufacturing engineer, I designed assembly fixutres and updated drawings with GD&T ensure mass-manufacturibility. In my next summer as a Mechanical Engineer, I designed a spring integral to the function of the device. My work on this device is under an NDA (all photos are stock images).
